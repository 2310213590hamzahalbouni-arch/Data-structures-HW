Week 11

1.  How do we perform clustering in a graph? Clustering in graphs is
    done by organizing nodes into groups where the connections within
    each group are denser than the connections with other groups. This
    process mainly follows two approaches:

-   Agglomerative (Bottom-Up): Each node begins as its own cluster, and
    similar nodes or clusters are gradually combined.
-   Divisive (Top-Down): The graph starts as a single cluster and is
    repeatedly divided into smaller clusters.

2.  How are clusters separated? Clusters are distinguished by detecting
    and cutting the edges that link different groups, often called
    bridge edges. Common techniques include:

-   Edge Betweenness: Removing edges that appear most frequently on
    shortest paths between nodes.
-   Modularity Optimization: Dividing the graph in a way that increases
    internal connections while reducing external ones.
-   Normalized Cuts: Applying matrix-based methods, such as the
    Laplacian matrix, to divide the graph into evenly balanced parts.
