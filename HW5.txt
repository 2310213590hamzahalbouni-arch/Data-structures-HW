Week 5 Homework — Shunting Yard Algorithm (Infix to Postfix Conversion)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  What is the Shunting Yard Algorithm? • The Shunting Yard Algorithm
    is a technique used to change mathematical expressions from Infix
    form (such as a+b) into Postfix form (also called Reverse Polish
    Notation). • It was created by Edsger Dijkstra. • This algorithm
    relies on a stack to temporarily store operators and parentheses
    while processing the expression.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.  How does it work? (Step-by-step) • Scan the expression from left to
    right. • When the token is an operand (a number or variable), place
    it directly in the output. • When the token is an operator (like +,
    -, *, /): • Remove operators from the stack and send them to the
    output if they have higher or equal priority. • Then place the
    current operator onto the stack. • If a left parenthesis ( is found,
    push it onto the stack. • If a right parenthesis ) is found, move
    operators from the stack to the output until a left parenthesis (
    appears, then remove the (. • Once the entire expression is
    processed, move any remaining operators from the stack to the
    output.

3.  Example 1: ab+c • Read a → operand → output: a • Read → operator →
    push * onto stack • Read b → operand → output: ab • Read + →
    operator: • * has greater precedence → move * to output → output: ab
    • push + onto stack • Read c → operand → output: abc • End of
    expression → pop remaining operator + → output: ab*c+

------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.  Example 2: (a+b)c • Read ( → push onto stack • Read a → operand →
    output: a • Read + → operator → push + onto stack • Read b → operand
    → output: ab • Read ) → pop operators until ( → pop + → output: ab+
    • Remove ( from stack • Read → operator → push * onto stack • Read c
    → operand → output: ab+c • End of expression → pop remaining
    operator * → output: ab+c*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.  Expected Output • For ab+c → abc+ • For (a+b)c → ab+c
